1. In the event that the application is made I believe there would be some ethical issues regarding 1.6 respect privacy where “Computing professionals should only use personal information for legitimate ends and without violating the rights of individuals and groups. This requires taking precautions to prevent re- identification of anonymized data or unauthorized data collection, ensuring the accuracy of data, understanding the provenance of the data, and protecting it from unauthorized access and accidental disclosure”. People may take advantage of the fact that they can connect with close by friends on yo. In Japan this feature would be frowned upon because it’s allowing one user to have the location of friends on the app that could potentially put users in danger.

2. Legal issues in Japan may include some problems with confidentiality. Japan’s rules on storing data state, “such notification or public announcement would likely cause harm to the life, body, property, rights or interests of an individual or third party”. Also the information that an application is allowed to include name, the purpose of use, and the procedures for addressing correction. However the ethics only explicitly states “Sensitive information means personal information comprising a principal’s race, creed, social status, medical history, criminal record, the fact of having suffered damage as a result of a crime, or other descriptions described by the cabinet order as those of which the handling requires special care so as not to cause unfair discrimination, prejudice or other disadvantage to the principal.” So the use of location isn’t explicitly prohibited by Japan’s ethics code.

3. Professional issues regarding the application include the businesses failure to keep clients and users information private. In the article, “Geolocation Data Tracking: What Are the Privacy Risks?” , the author says, “apps such as Tinder and Happn are infamous for oversharing, and many businesses are just starting to recognize that proper protection begins with basic access controls.” Therefore it is smart as a business to keep track of what information your application shares.
